Starting off with one of the most over-used tropes in programming to introduce another, a tech/random thoughts/brain dump blog.

### What this blog is:
- A place for me to write breakdowns of new topics that I encounter while working as a back-end Ruby on Rails dev
- An opportunity to improve my understanding of CS related topics via writing hopefully useful guides/ TIL (Today I learned) style posts
- A distraction from the bug tickets I am supposed to be fixingâ€¦

### What this blog isn't:
- A comprehensive source of knowledge on any topics posted
- The 'right' way to do things
- Interesting (I don't expect anyone to read this but if one person can be helped by anything written here then that would be great)

Hopefully I can share a few useful things on here and if anyone wants to get in contant please see my GH and LinkedIn linked above.

Cheers!
